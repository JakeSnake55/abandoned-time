Second game (2d platformer)

Download the JRE from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJM_ANb9WXcdBYPimRiXMLxeq4SfUIrQ/view?usp=sharing
The JRE is too large to share by github. For download without this, get JRE 15.0.2, and put in the same folder as the other files

Any bugs or issues with installation can be listed in the issues tab, I can see that easily
